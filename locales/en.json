    "title": "About",
    "p1": "I'm a software engineer from California, now based in Munich. I spent over two years at SPA in San Diego, where I built production-ready tools for defense clients and eventually stepped into a program lead role. That experience taught me how to take ownership, navigate complexity, and get things across the finish line without waiting to be asked.",
    "p2": "Now I'm pursuing a Master's in Informatics at TUM, focusing on computer vision and machine learning. I chose TUM for the challenge—the program is tough, well-regarded, and full of opportunities to stretch myself. Munich also has a strong tech and startup scene, which is exactly what I was looking for.",
    "p3": "I've been coding since I was a kid. What drew me in was how easy it was to get started. I didn't need fancy hardware, just a laptop and the will to build something, and I've always loved that kind of creative freedom. These days, I still enjoy building side projects, especially tools that solve niche problems or help communities run more smoothly.",
    "p4": "I'm currently open to part-time / working-student roles in Munich. Something in computer vision or ML would be ideal, but I'm also open to full-stack roles where I can work with smart people and ship real things. I do well in agile, fast-moving teams, and I'm comfortable either leading or supporting as needed. I like to ask questions, push back when necessary, and stay flexible as ideas evolve.",
    "p5": "One thing I try to live by: don't oversell, just deliver great work and let that speak for itself.",
    "p6": "I'm bilingual in English and German, and always happy to connect. Shoot me a message on LinkedIn! :)"
